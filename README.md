# WebDeploy-Automation

Automate the deployment of a simple static website on AWS EC2 using Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and GitHub.

---

## Project Overview

**WebDeploy-Automation** sets up a fully automated pipeline to deploy a static website:

1. **Terraform** provisions an EC2 instance in AWS.
2. **Ansible** configures the instance, installs Apache2, and deploys HTML/CSS/JS files.
3. **Jenkins** automates the CI/CD process whenever changes are pushed to GitHub.
4. **GitHub** stores the website source code.

This project demonstrates **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **configuration management**, and **automated deployment pipelines**.
